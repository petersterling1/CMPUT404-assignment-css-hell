	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<img src="images/me.jpg">
	<p>
	My name is Peter Sterling. I'm in my last year at University of Alberta for a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. I enjoy web development and have experience in both front end and back end.
	</p>
	<h2>Professional History</h2>
	<p>
	For the past six months, I have working on bringing together technology and teaching with the Department of Educational Psychology. We are developing a game in Unreal 4 where disabled children will play online from their homes and complete tasks together that have been designed by psychologists in an attempt to mitigate their symptoms.
	</p>
	<h2>Skills</h2>
	<p>
	As I near the completion of my degree, I have skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, C#, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, Unity, and Unreal Engine 4. I am currently learning Django and CUDA.
